# Student handbook project

This is a hybrid app built with Ionic v3 framework and Firebase database.


## Getting Started

Latest version of the Ionic CLI and Cordova CLI are needed for creating Ionic projects. Before you do that, youâ€™ll need a recent version of Node.js. [Install Node.js 6](https://nodejs.org/) or greater and then proceed to install the Ionic CLI and Cordova.

```
$ npm install -g ionic cordova
```


### Copy project files and install project dependencies

With Ionic and Cordova in place, clone this repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eaailkal/hb.git
```

Once the process is completed, navigate to the project directory and run

```
npm install
```
